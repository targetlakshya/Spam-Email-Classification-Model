**Problem Statement**

Build and train a Machine learning model with good accuracy to detect emails as spam or ham (no spam). We should use standard libraries available for Machine learning model building.

**Prerequisites**
This is going to little a lengthy tutorial so be ready with your coffee and make sure the following software is already installed on your machine:

1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Visual Studio Code or Editor of your choice

You should also install the Anaconda package that contains the majority of the libraries we need for Machine learning in Python.

I also assume that you know the basics of Machine learning and Python because I won't be digging too deep into basic concepts.

**Dataset**

To train any model, you need a pre-defined dataset that contains good and clean data. By clean I mean it should not have null values, ambiguous data or empty data.
